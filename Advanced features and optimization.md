# Project phase 3 - Advanced features and optimization (Optional)

## üéØ Chosen Use Case or Feature to Improve

For this phase, we chose to improve the Player View Page and the overall website layout. We focused on making the Player View Page more interactive and improving the uniformity of the design across the website. The reason we selected this feature is that, while the core functionality was working well, the user experience could be improved by making the interface more consistent across different pages.

## üîç Original Definition

The original requirement for the Player View Page was to display and edit player stats, health, stamina, and equipment. The page was functional but lacked interactivity and a consistent design with the rest of the website. There was also need for improvement in how the elements were presented.

## üîÑ Implementation

In this phase, we made some adjustments and improvements:  
- **Minor Adjustments to CSS Layout**  
We made small changes to the CSS layout to make sure the design elements on the page were better aligned. This made the layout cleaner and more organized, which helps users find information more easily. We also worked on the spacing and alignment to improve the overall look of the page.  

- **Uniform Button Layout**  
To create a consistent user experience, we made sure the button layouts were consistent throughout the website. All buttons now follow a the same design, making the app more organised. This change ensures that users will immediately recognize how to interact with elements like buttons for saving or editing.  

- **Improved Player View Page Interactivity**  
We made the Player View Page more interactive by adding features like inline editing for player stats and equipment. This allows users to update their profiles without navigating to a different page, making the app more user-friendly and responsive. The new interactions were tested to make sure they were smooth.  

- What technical changes were required?  
  We updated the CSS files to adjust layouts and improve the consistency of design across different pages.  
  We made it possible to edit player details directly on the Player View Page using React. This required us to implement logic for handling changes      directly on the page without needing to refresh or redirect the user to another screen.  

- What technologies, methods or structures did you use?
  React.js was used to create interactive components, especially for the inline editing on the Player View Page.  
  CSS was used for styling and layout adjustments, ensuring the buttons and elements were uniform across the website.  
  
- What challenges did you encounter and how did you solve them?  
  **Challenge:** An issue we faced was maintaining consistency across different parts of the application, especially with the buttons and layout. Some      parts of the app had slightly different button styles, making the interface look inconsistent.  
  **Solution:** We solved this by going through all the pages and applying the same button and styles, ensuring a uniform look throughout.  

  **Challenge:** Another challenge was making sure the inline editing feature worked smoothly.  
  **Solution:** We tested the feature and fixed any minor issues that came up.
