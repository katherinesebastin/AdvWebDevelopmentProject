# Project phase 4 - Presentation

## 🎲 Digital Score & Stat Keeper
A tool for managing tabletop RPG campaigns  

Created by: Alena Genkinger & Katherine Sebastin  

## What the app can do (Use Cases)

✅ Create and manage profiles and campaigns   
✅ Add and edit player stats and items  
✅ Write Game Log entries (players and GM)  
✅ GM has extra permissions    
✅ View player profiles  

## What we improved in Phase 3

- More interactive Player View Page    
- Inline editing (edit stats on the same page)    
- Uniform button styles and layout    
- Better spacing and design with CSS  

## Tech and Tools

**Frontend:** React (interactive pages)    
**Backend:** Node.js + Express (handles data)    
**Database:** PostgreSQL (stores info)    
**Styling:** CSS (clean layout and spacing)    
**Version Control:** Git (shared work)  

## Challenges

❌ Button styles were different on some pages    
✔️ Fixed by going through each page and matching styles  

❌ Inline editing was hard to make smooth    
✔️ Fixed by testing and adjusting the code  

## Time Spent: 50.5 hours

Planning, design, defining features, personas, use cases, technical design, prototypes – 16.5 h    
Backend setup, frontend features, database work, fixing bugs, styling – 29 h

## Future Plans
