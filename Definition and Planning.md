# Project phase 1 - Definition and planning

## 1. User Personas

### 1: Game Master (GM) Alex 
Age: 32  
Role: Game Master (GM)  
Experience Level: Experienced player and GM  
Goals:    
- Ensure smooth and balanced gameplay for all players.  
- Track and adjust player stats discreetly when necessary.  
- Maintain a dynamic and immersive game world with hidden clues and narrative twists.  
- Manage various game mechanics, including player abilities, NPC stats, and environmental conditions, in real-time.  
- Avoid gameplay disruptions caused by players losing track of their character stats or abilities.  

Frustrations:  
- Players often lose their character sheets, making it hard to track progress and stats.  
- Having to manually calculate or remember player stats or hidden information (e.g., NPC stats, secret clues).  
- Keeping track of complex, changing scenarios, like damage dealt over multiple rounds or long-term player conditions (poison, curses, etc.).    
- Losing narrative flow due to delays in gathering information.  

Needs:  
- A tool to override player stats quickly, without disrupting the game.  
- A system that allows adding hidden notes or clues that only the GM can view.  
- A game log that provides an easy access to history of events, changes to stats, and updates on character status.  
- Organized data for tracking multiple players' stats, abilities, and progress during the game.  
- A customizable interface to accommodate different styles of gameplay and house rules.  

Usage Scenario:  
Alex is running a long campaign and needs to adjust one player's stats secretly after a combat encounter. Using the tool, Alex clicks the "Override Stats" button, enters the necessary changes, and quickly updates the player's profile without disrupting the session. Also, Alex can make notes for secret objectives that only they can see. The game log automatically updates with a timestamp, ensuring that everything is recorded in case of disputes or future reference.
