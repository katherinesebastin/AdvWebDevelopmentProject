# Project phase 1 - Definition and planning

## 1. User Personas

### 1: Game Master (GM) Alex
Age: 32  
Role: Game Master (GM)  
Experience Level: Experienced player and GM  
Goals:    
- Ensure smooth and balanced gameplay for all players.  
- Track and adjust player stats discreetly when necessary.  
- Maintain a dynamic and immersive game world with hidden clues and narrative twists.  
- Manage various game mechanics, including player abilities, NPC stats, and environmental conditions, in real-time.  
- Avoid gameplay disruptions caused by players losing track of their character stats or abilities.  

Frustrations:  
- Players often lose their character sheets, making it hard to track progress and stats.  
- Having to manually calculate or remember player stats or hidden information (e.g., NPC stats, secret clues).  
- Keeping track of complex, changing scenarios, like damage dealt over multiple rounds or long-term player conditions (poison, curses, etc.).    
- Losing narrative flow due to delays in gathering information.  

Needs:  
- A tool to override player stats quickly, without disrupting the game.  
- A system that allows adding hidden notes or clues that only the GM can view.  
- A game log that provides an easy access to history of events, changes to stats, and updates on character status.  
- Organized data for tracking multiple players' stats, abilities, and progress during the game.  
- A customizable interface to accommodate different styles of gameplay and house rules.  

Usage Scenario:  
Alex is running a long campaign and needs to adjust one player's stats secretly after a combat encounter. Using the tool, Alex clicks the "Override Stats" button, enters the necessary changes, and quickly updates the player's profile without disrupting the session. Also, Alex can make notes for secret objectives that only they can see. The game log automatically updates with a timestamp, ensuring that everything is recorded in case of disputes or future reference.  

### 2: Player Sam
Age: 25  
Role: Player  
Experience Level: Moderate experience, plays regularly but is not always familiar with every rule or detail.  
Goals:  
- Keep track of character stats (health, skills, inventory, etc.) accurately throughout the session.  
- Quickly update equipment, abilities, or any other changes as they occur during the game.  
- Ensure their character progress is well-documented and easy to access.  
- Focus on roleplaying without worrying about the technical side of the game.  

Frustrations:  
- Forgetting to update stats after gaining new items, spells, or abilities during the session.  
- Losing character progress due to updates not being logged correctly.  
- Difficulty navigating complex character sheets that require a lot of scrolling and manual input.  

Needs:  
- Editable stats with an intuitive interface for quick changes.  
- A simple UI that allows them to update stats during the game (e.g., adding equipment or changing health).  
- A shared game log to reference past decisions or changes.  
- A clear and organized character profile that doesn’t require excessive searching or management.   

Usage Scenario:  
During the game, Sam's character picks up a new magical item. To quickly update their profile, Sam clicks the "Edit Stats" button and adds the item to their inventory. The system saves the change, and a log entry is added so everyone can see the new item. Later, Sam notices they forgot to update their HP after a tough battle and uses the tool to fix it, ensuring the game continues without breaking immersion.  

### 3: New Player Jamie
Age: 18  
Role: Beginner Player  
Experience Level: New to TTRPGs, learning the rules and systems of the game.  
Goals:  
- Learn the mechanics of the game without feeling overwhelmed.  
- Keep track of their character's stats and progress in an easy-to-understand manner.  
- Focus on learning and participating without worrying about complicated calculations or sheet management.  
- Enjoy a seamless, fun experience where they can interact with others without frustration.  

Frustrations:  
- Feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of character sheets and game mechanics.  
- Difficulty understanding where to update certain stats or when to make changes.  
- Getting lost in rules or forgetfulness about which stats need to be tracked.  
- Confusion around navigating the digital tool, especially when things are not immediately clear.  

Needs:  
- A user-friendly interface that explains things step-by-step and provides clear guidance.  
- Easy-to-edit character profiles with large text and organized sections.  
- Tooltips or explanations for certain stats and features to help them learn as they play.  
- Prompted updates to remind them when to update specific stats (e.g., HP after damage).  
- Pre-made templates for character creation to streamline the learning process.  

Usage Scenario:  
Jamie is new to roleplaying games and has just created their first character. The tool walks them through the profile creation, explaining what each section means (e.g., HP, skills, and inventory). Jamie then enters a battle but forgets to update their HP after taking damage. A pop-up notification gently reminds Jamie to update their health, and they easily adjust their stats. Over time, Jamie becomes more familiar with the system and starts using it with ease.  

### 4: Veteran Player Riley
Age: 29  
Role: Veteran Player  
Experience Level: Highly experienced, has played multiple systems, and often creates their own campaigns.  
Goals:  
- Track complex character builds and abilities that evolve over time.  
- Maintain a detailed record of their character's achievements, skills, and growth.  
- Customize and optimize their character’s stats during gameplay.
- Seamlessly integrate their personal character development with the larger game narrative.  
- Ensure quick, easy access to complex character information without clutter.  

Frustrations:  
- Standard character sheets do not provide enough flexibility for custom abilities or complex character builds.  
- Difficulty tracking detailed long-term progressions or changes (e.g., multi-stage quests, evolving abilities).  
- Overwhelmed by poorly organized digital tools that do not allow for customization.  
- Wants tools that support advanced features, but are not overly complicated to use during gameplay.  

Needs:

- A complex character profile that can handle long-term development (e.g., evolving skills, personal goals).
- Advanced filters for tracking character progression across different campaigns.  
- A clean, minimalist interface that can handle detailed data without being overwhelming.  
- Quick access to important stats, abilities, or items in a streamlined format during gameplay.  

Usage Scenario:  
Riley is running a powerful spellcaster character with multiple abilities that evolve over time. They use the tool to track each ability's level and any unique upgrades, applying them to the character profile as needed. Riley can easily modify and update complex stats and abilities during the session and uses the advanced search features to view any changes made across different campaigns. The tool ensures that Riley’s gameplay remains smooth, even when using complex, customized character builds.

### 5: Supportive Sidekick Taylor
Age: 26  
Role: Support Character (NPC or Temporary Player)  
Experience Level: Beginner to intermediate, mostly plays supporting roles in campaigns.  
Goals:  
- Track support stats for NPC characters or temporary players who assist the main party.  
- Help other players by providing healing, buffs, or additional gameplay mechanics without managing their own full character sheet.  
- Maintain an overview of their role and resources in a collaborative manner without deep complexity.  
- Ensure the supporting character’s abilities and resources are accessible but not overly complex.  

Frustrations:  
- Support roles often feel neglected or underrepresented in traditional character sheets.  
- Difficulty in tracking limited-use abilities (e.g., spells, items) that regenerate over time.  
- Finds it hard to keep up with the main players, especially when managing multiple NPCs or temporary roles.  

Needs:  
- Simplified NPC character profiles that allow for easy tracking of support abilities and resources.  
- Quick update system for limited-use abilities, such as healing potions, spells, or buffs.  
- A way to easily switch between NPCs or side characters in a single campaign, keeping the primary characters at the forefront without confusion.  
- Collaborative features, allowing the GM to quickly update NPC stats or abilities when necessary.  
- Minimalistic stat tracking that doesn’t require detailed input but still provides accurate gameplay results.  

Usage Scenario:  
Taylor is playing a healing NPC who supports the main group, providing buffs and healing spells as needed. They easily track the number of healing potions used and the cooldown on the NPC's healing abilities. As the group enters a dungeon, Taylor quickly adjusts the stats and resources of their NPC using the tool’s simple interface. The GM updates the NPC’s health and abilities during the session, allowing Taylor to focus on the roleplaying aspect without getting bogged down by technical details.
